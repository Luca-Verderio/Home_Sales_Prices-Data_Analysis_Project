This assignment is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course.

## Introduction
Choosing the right residential property to buy can be a daunting task, especially for investors, whose aim is maximising the return on investment (ROI).

In fact, many questions may arise when selecting a property: is a newly built house worth more than an older one? How important is the view? How does the square footage impact the price? And so on.

In a nutshell, what are the factors that determine home sales prices?

## Objective
The scope of this analysis is to investigate how different features impact the value of a property, identifying the leading factors that influence home sales prices.
The analysis has been carried out using data relative to home sales prices in the King County, WA, USA, in the period from April 2014 to May 2015.
This county includes 39 cities, with Seattle being the largest (and county seat).
